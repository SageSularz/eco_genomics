Physiological meachanisms of development plasticity "How do animals acclimate?"

potential experimental questions

-   does the temp that they expereince growing up affect ULT?

-   How does gene expression response differ between 28 and 33 degrees and does this differ with baseline?

-   What genes are differentially expressed at DT 22 compared to DT 18?

factors

-   development temp

    -   levels = 18 & 22

-   Final temp

    -   levels = baseline (BASE) & 28 (A28) & 33 (A33)
